# Threaded Transaction Execution Engine

This document describes the implementation of the thread-based transaction execution engine in the Binomena protocol layer.

## Overview

The Threaded Transaction Execution Engine provides automatic switching between single-threaded and multi-threaded transaction processing based on the number of active delegates in the network. This feature is designed to:

- **Start lightweight**: Begin with simple single-threaded execution during early network stages
- **Scale automatically**: Switch to parallel execution as the network grows
- **Maintain integrity**: Ensure state consistency regardless of execution mode
- **Provide transparency**: Clear logging of execution mode and performance metrics

## Architecture

### Components

1. **ExecutionEngine** (`core/execution_engine.go`)
   - Manages transaction execution with support for both single-threaded and multi-threaded processing
   - Handles worker pools, batching, and state integrity checks
   - Automatically switches execution modes based on delegate count

2. **Protocol** (`core/protocol.go`)
   - Coordinates between consensus, blockchain, and execution engine
   - Monitors delegate count and triggers mode switches
   - Provides high-level transaction processing interface

3. **DPoS Integration** (`consensus/dpos.go`)
   - Enhanced with `GetActiveDelegateCount()` method
   - Provides delegate counting for threshold determination

## Configuration

### Default Settings

```go
ExecutionConfig{
    DelegateThreshold:     11,                    // Enable multithreading when > 11 delegates
    MaxWorkers:            runtime.NumCPU(),      // Use all available CPU cores
    BatchSize:             100,                   // Process 100 transactions per batch
    Timeout:               30 * time.Second,      // 30 second timeout
    EnableIntegrityChecks: true,                  // Enable integrity checks by default
}

ProtocolConfig{
    DelegateCheckInterval: 10 * time.Second,      // Check delegate count every 10 seconds
    EnableAutoMode:        true,                  // Enable automatic mode switching
}
```

### Customization

You can customize the execution engine behavior by providing custom configuration:

```go
config := &core.ExecutionConfig{
    DelegateThreshold:     15,                    // Custom threshold
    MaxWorkers:            8,                     // Limit to 8 workers
    BatchSize:             50,                    // Smaller batches
    Timeout:               60 * time.Second,      // Longer timeout
    EnableIntegrityChecks: true,                  // Keep integrity checks
}

executionEngine := core.NewExecutionEngine(config)
```

## Usage

### Basic Integration

```go
import (
    "github.com/igo-used/binomena/core"
    "github.com/igo-used/binomena/consensus"
)

// Initialize components
blockchain := core.NewBlockchain()
dposConsensus := consensus.NewDPoSConsensus(founderAddr, communityAddr)
tokenSystem := token.NewBinomToken()

// Create protocol with default configuration
protocol := core.NewProtocol(blockchain, dposConsensus, tokenSystem, nil)

// Start the protocol layer
protocol.Start()
defer protocol.Stop()

// Process transactions
results, err := protocol.ProcessTransactions(transactions)
```

### Custom Configuration

```go
protocolConfig := &core.ProtocolConfig{
    ExecutionConfig: &core.ExecutionConfig{
        DelegateThreshold:     8,                // Lower threshold for testing
        MaxWorkers:            4,                // Limit workers
        BatchSize:             25,               // Smaller batches
        Timeout:               15 * time.Second, // Shorter timeout
        EnableIntegrityChecks: true,
    },
    DelegateCheckInterval: 5 * time.Second,      // More frequent checks
    EnableAutoMode:        true,
}

protocol := core.NewProtocol(blockchain, consensus, tokenSystem, protocolConfig)
```

## Execution Modes

### Single-Threaded Mode

**Activated when**: Active delegates â‰¤ threshold (default: 11)

**Characteristics**:
- Sequential transaction processing
- Lower CPU usage
- Simpler state management
- Ideal for early network stages

**Logging**:
```
Transaction execution engine initialized - Mode: Single-Threaded, Max Workers: 8, Delegate Threshold: 11
Executing 5 transactions in Single-Threaded mode
```

### Multi-Threaded Mode

**Activated when**: Active delegates > threshold (default: 11)

**Characteristics**:
- Parallel transaction processing in batches
- Higher throughput potential
- Worker pool management
- State locking for consistency

**Logging**:
```
Execution mode changed: Single-Threaded -> Multi-Threaded (Active Delegates: 12, Threshold: 11)
Executing 20 transactions in Multi-Threaded mode
```

## State Integrity

### Integrity Checks

The execution engine includes comprehensive state integrity validation:

1. **Blockchain Integrity**
   - Validates hash chains
   - Checks block index consistency
   - Verifies transaction prefixes

2. **Concurrency Safety**
   - State locking during parallel execution
   - Batch-level integrity verification
   - Transaction ordering preservation

3. **Error Handling**
   - Failed transactions are logged with reasons
   - Batch failures trigger rollback mechanisms
   - State consistency is maintained on errors

### Example Integrity Check

```go
func (e *ExecutionEngine) performIntegrityCheck(blockchain BlockchainInterface, tokenSystem interface{}) error {
    // Verify blockchain integrity
    chain := blockchain.GetChain()
    for i := 1; i < len(chain); i++ {
        if chain[i].PreviousHash != chain[i-1].Hash {
            return fmt.Errorf("blockchain integrity violation at block %d", i)
        }
    }
    return nil
}
```

## Monitoring and Logging

### Execution Statistics

Get real-time statistics about the execution engine:

```go
stats := protocol.GetExecutionStats()
// Returns:
// {
//     "mode": "Multi-Threaded",
//     "max_workers": 8,
//     "batch_size": 100,
//     "delegate_threshold": 11,
//     "integrity_checks": true,
//     "last_delegate_count": 15,
//     "is_running": true
// }
```

### Log Messages

The system provides comprehensive logging:

**Mode Changes**:
```
Delegate count changed: 10 -> 12, Execution mode: Multi-Threaded
```

**Transaction Processing**:
```
[par-0-1] Executing transaction AdNetest123...: AdNetest456... -> AdNetest789... (100.000000)
Transaction execution completed in 45ms - Processed: 20, Successful: 19, Failed: 1
```

**Configuration Validation**:
```
Protocol Configuration:
  - Execution Mode: Multi-Threaded
  - Max Workers: 8
  - Delegate Threshold: 11
  - Active Delegates: 15
```

## Performance Considerations

### Batch Processing

Transactions are processed in configurable batches to balance:
- **Throughput**: Larger batches for higher throughput
- **Latency**: Smaller batches for lower latency
- **Memory usage**: Batch size affects memory consumption

### Worker Pool Management

The execution engine uses a worker pool to limit resource usage:
- **Max Workers**: Configurable limit on concurrent goroutines
- **Worker Slots**: Semaphore-based worker allocation
- **Resource Cleanup**: Proper goroutine lifecycle management

### State Locking Strategy

For parallel execution, the engine employs strategic locking:
- **Global State Lock**: Protects critical state modifications
- **Minimal Lock Duration**: Locks held only during essential operations
- **Deadlock Prevention**: Consistent lock ordering

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Q: Execution engine stays in single-threaded mode despite high delegate count**
A: Check that `DelegateCheckInterval` allows enough time for detection and verify delegate registration succeeded.

**Q: High memory usage in multi-threaded mode**
A: Reduce `BatchSize` and `MaxWorkers` to limit concurrent processing.

**Q: Transaction failures increase in multi-threaded mode**
A: Enable `EnableIntegrityChecks` and check for state consistency issues.

**Q: Performance degradation with many workers**
A: Reduce `MaxWorkers` to optimal value (typically 2x CPU cores).

### Debug Logging

Enable detailed logging for debugging:

```go
config := &core.ExecutionConfig{
    EnableIntegrityChecks: true,  // Enable detailed integrity checks
}
```

grep "Execution mode changed" application.log
```

## Conclusion

The Threaded Transaction Execution Engine provides a robust foundation for scaling transaction processing in the Binomena network. By automatically switching between execution modes based on network growth, it ensures optimal performance while maintaining state integrity and system reliability.

The implementation is designed to be lightweight during early network stages while providing the scalability needed for high-throughput transaction processing as the network matures.
